# OTNet Media Desktop Encoder

**OTNet** is a powerful, all-in-one desktop application built to encode and prepare media for secure web streaming. Whether you're looking to deliver video through HLS or DASH, apply DRM protection, or generate playback-ready media with advanced tools — OTNet provides everything you need in one streamlined package.

## 🔥 What is OTNet?

OTNet is designed to help creators, developers, and publishers encode media directly on their computer, upload it to AWS, and serve it securely over the web. It supports streaming protocols like HLS and MPEG-DASH, and integrates with DRM providers like **BuyDRM** and **EZDRM** for secure playback.

OTNet also includes a lightweight player and WordPress plugins to embed encoded streams directly into your website with ease. With growing support for platforms like Elementor and flexible API integration, OTNet is built to fit your workflow.
